# jetsonhacks-utils

A collection of small, useful scripts stored as GitHub gists. This repo is just a central index—check the links below to grab what you need.

## Scripts
| Script             | Purpose                         | Gist Link                              | Raw URL                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `check_so_dependencies.sh` | Find missing dependencies in .so file | [Gist](https://gist.github.com/jetsonhacks/3bd3e4a1c7a8d0e81a6126a9e05d4e25) | [Raw](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jetsonhacks/3bd3e4a1c7a8d0e81a6126a9e05d4e25/raw/27a571d4de603b28a6a565fee7baa14b8667d1f5/check_so_dependencies.sh) |

## How to Use
- **Browse**: Click the "Gist" link to view the script and its details.
- **Grab**: Use the "Raw" URL to download directly (e.g., `wget <raw-url>`).
- **Run**: Most scripts are standalone—check the gist description for any dependencies.

## Notes
- The scripts directory holds a script that will create a gist from a file and add it to this type of README
- Scripts are unrelated utilities I use occasionally. No grand theme here—just stuff that works.
- Want to add one? I’ll toss it in a gist and update this list.
